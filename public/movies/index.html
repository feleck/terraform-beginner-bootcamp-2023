    <h1>Welcome to the Noir Movies Page!</h1>
    <p>he phrase film noir was first coined in 1946 by a group 
      of French critics to describe the emerging movement of 
      mainly black and white Hollywood films with dark, 
      pessimistic themes and signature motifs such as 
      alienated antiheroes, rain slicked streets, 
      dark shadows and seductive femme fatales.
      Neo-noir is a revival of film noir, 
      a genre that had originally flourished during the 
      post-World War II era in the United Statesâ€”roughly 
      from 1940 to 1960.</p>
